<div class="about"> 
	<h2>ABOUT THE WINERY</h2>
	<p>Morgan Creek Vineyards is a family owned business that is located in the southern Minnesota. They were the first winery to open in the region and the 5th winery to be built in the state. The winery is owned by a husband and wife duo, Georg and Paula Marti, where they have their two sons, Adam and Ben, working side by side to support the business. The Marti’s are known to be pioneers and creative thinkers. They used to own a music school teaching the Suzuki method. With their latest endeavor they are aspiring to be a biodynamic vineyard &amp; winery. The owners want to incorporate the concept of biodynamics into their winery branding. This will be a branding expansion project where I will be using their existing brand and freshening up the look with an icon series, and label series. The goal is to express &amp; promote biodynamics through the branding.</p>

<div class="biodynamic">
	<h2>WHAT IS BIODYNAMICS?</h2>	
	<p>You might be wondering, what is biodynamics? It is an ecological, holistic, &amp; earth conscious form of farming that was founded by the philosopher &amp; scientist Rudolf Steiner. Many of the methods used in biodynamics are created in consideration of how all elements work together. For example there are animals such as sheep on the farm to prune the weeds, fermented manure that enhances the root systems, and a lunar calendar that determines the different treatments for a variety of plants. Similar to organic farming the use of chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides are strictly prohibited. </p>

	<p>Biodynamics is an important concept to explore because it is a great holistic tool to combat climate change and promotes healthier soil and habitats. The challenge here is to incorporate biodynamics and Kandinsky inspired elements into their pre-existing brand.</p>

<div class="inspiration_1">
	<h2>Inspiration</h2>
	<p>The biggest question here is what kind of visual style should I go with? What kind of visual system should I come up with? Color? Shapes? The client already had an answer to that. She said that Wassily Kandinsky, the renowned abstract artist, had an association to biodynamics. He explored concepts such as eurythmy (an aspect of biodynamics that expresses movement through art) through his art making. So the images throughout the branding expansion either have Kandinsky accents or are directly inspired by his compositions.</p>

	<p>The image below is a wine label that I designed a few months prior to starting this project. The client wanted a label for a small batch limited series wine they were developing named Krambambuli. The name has its roots in 18th century Germany and is most often associated with a specialty drink that is made during the winter season. As you can see the label’s image is inspired by Kandinsky’s art and the playful nature of the name. There are similar variations of these gestures throughout the branding.</p>

<div class="ex_brand">
	<h2>Existing Brand</h2>
	<p>Here is the established brand for Morgan Creek Vineyards. The Celtic knot represents the four seasons, interconnection, and the owner’s Irish heritage. The font Charlemagne STD – Regular complements the Celtic knot. The swooping ‘M’ represents the Morgan Creek and is also the initial to the business. The image below demonstrates how the logo breaks down into its smaller size, what the standard font looks like, and shows the composition the business uses.</p>

<div class="process">
	<h2>Process</h2>
	<p>At first I started looking at Kandinsky compositions that were from his Russian Avant-Garde/ Bauhaus phase. Within this phase he has very distinct marking that would be effective in making graphics due to the bold and geometric nature. So I would scan the compositions and pick up some elements that would be applicable to graphics that pertained to biodynamics, such as a dandelion.</p>
</div>

	<div id="firsticons" class='parallaxify'>
	</div>

<div class="solution">
<h2>Arriving at a Solution</h2>
	<p>I went through many sketching phases. I came up with several icons but I wasn’t satisfied with the look. As I was doing my research I came across Pentagram Studios Garden Museum graphics. They created these abstract Henry Matisse like botanical icons that could be used in a modular fashion. There seemed to be more flexibility in applying the graphics especially when the images can mostly be contained in a circle or a square. Hence why the graphics are modular. So I redirected my drawings to be confined to rectangular compositions. Then after that the designing process snowballed into what you see here.</p>

<div class="geovsaccent">
<h2>GEOMETRIC VS. ACCENT</h2>
	<p>There came a point while designing the icons weather to go fully into geometric Kandinsky-esk style or to tone it back to make the images more recognizable. With the geometric shapes, icons were less recognizable which wouldn’t be good if these icons where used to make the public aware of biodynamics. So I started to take a different approach, freed up the style of lines/shapes but still keeping them somewhat geometric and started adding Kandinsky accents.</p>

<div class="deliverables">
<h2>DELIVERABLES</h2><br>

	<h3>ICON SERIES</h3>
		<p>These icons need to reflect the biodynamic 9 preparations that are iconic in the movement, as well as making symbols that pertain only to Morgan Creek Vineyards.</p><br>

	<h3>WINE LABEL SERIES</h3>
		<p>There are 3 different wine labels for the series: red, white, and dessert wines. All of the labels need to carrying the Kandinsky theme as well as incorporating elements of biodynamics.</p>

<div class="inspiration_2">
	<h2>Label Inspiration</h2>
	<p>I was inspired by Kandinsky’s use of gestural lines. So I abstracted gestural lines from the Morgan Creek where the winery resides. I chose 3 different areas of the river that would have a different line gestures to create variety between the different wine labels. Drawing these lines from the Morgan Creek itself further tailored the design for only Morgan Creek Vineyards.</p>
</div>

	<div id="creekmap" class='parallaxify'>
	</div>


<div class="label">
	<h2>Wine Label Series</h2>
	<p>The wine labels have lots of meaning in them. The grid-like line gestures represent the landscape. The abstracted icons from the larger icons represent the biodynamic plants grown at the vineyard. The creek flowing through the property provides a focal point, and the rectangles represent the buildings. The color scheme was pulled from the Kandinsky painting that was used in the original brand (segment from ‘Improvisation XIV’, 1910).</p>

<div class="flexability">
	<h2>Flexibility</h2>
	<p>The brand extension that I created allows for flexibility due to its modular design. It can be used in patterns, T-shirts, bags, photography, menus, business stationary, festival branding, and much more. The icons are not just a great tool to create awareness of biodynamics but also serves to promote the winery’s unique location along the Morgan Creek valley. This fresh new look will definitely make the winery stick out of the crowd. It will attract more sophisticated audiences who appreciate the arts as well as the next generation of wine lovers.</p>
